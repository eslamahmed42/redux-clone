# Redux Clone
ðŸ“– A re-implementation of Redux for learning purposes.

For simplicity, I didn't use any modularization or build processes.

The repository, simply, contains 3 files:
- **index.html**: Used for hosting.
- **redux.js**: Implementation code.
- **index.js**: Test code.

The implementation is heavily-commented, and easy to understand.

Disclaimer: This is **not** a *React Redux* clone. You can use it to build one, though.
